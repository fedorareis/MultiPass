# multiPass
The group password manager

The basic idea behind this project is that users can share groups of passwords with other users. I had this idea after working for in an IT department and seeing their need to share the passwords between the members fo the department without having to create different repositories for every person. This solves the problem by allowing users to share an entire group of passwords with another person.

Currently only basic functionality exists: a user can view, add, and share passwords. Hopefully in the near future I will get a chance to implement some of the other features I have been thinking of.
