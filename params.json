{"name":"Multipass","tagline":"The group password manager","body":"# MultiPass\r\nThe group password manager\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind this project is that users can share groups of passwords with other users. I had this idea after working for in an IT department and seeing their need to share the passwords between the members of the department without having to create different repositories for every person. This solves the problem by allowing users to share an entire group of passwords with another person.\r\n\r\nCurrently only basic functionality exists: a user can view, add, and share passwords. Hopefully in the near future I will get a chance to implement some of the other features I have been thinking of.\r\n\r\nAll design and implementation was done by me with some oversight and suggestions from a security professor at Cal Poly, to make sure I didn't completely mess up the security.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Kyle Reis","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
